# Edge AI Platform for Building Energy & IAQ Optimization

This project is a test submission for a full-time AI engineering position. It aims to build a production-ready Edge AI platform that:

- Deploys open-source LLMs on-premise
- Analyzes real-time IoT data from building systems (IAQ sensors and power meters)
- Provides intelligent recommendations
- Optimizes building operations autonomously

## Main Components
- **LLM Model Selection & Edge Deployment**: Research and deploy the best open-source LLM for edge use, optimized with TensorRT.
- **Volttron Integration & Data Simulation**: Simulate IAQ sensors and power meters, store data in TimescaleDB, and bridge LLM with Volttron for real-time recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation & Safety**: Evaluate with NVIDIA NeMo Eval and implement safety guardrails.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Use LangSmith for tracking usage, recommendations, and system health.

## Deliverables
- Codebase (this repo)
- Planning diagrams (sequence/flow chart)
- YouTube demo video link
